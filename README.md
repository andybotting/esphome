# muart-group/esphome

ESPHome fork for development of the `mitsubishi_uart` component. Check out the documentation for more info: [muart-group.github.io/](muart-group.github.io/).

#### The [`dev` branch](https://github.com/muart-group/esphome/tree/dev) is the branch targeted for merging upstream to ESPHome.

#### The [`muart/edge` branch](https://github.com/muart-group/esphome/tree/muart/edge) contains new experimental features for testing.

Once [this PR](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/pull/6794) is merged, bugs can be reported in the main ESPHome issue tracking repository.  Until then, all issues may be reported here.  (Experimental feature requests or exploration may still end up living here instead of in ESPHome, but we'll have to see)
